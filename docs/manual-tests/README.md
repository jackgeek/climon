# Manual test plan

Explicit, human-run test cases that prove each feature is implemented correctly,
with **configuration matrices** for cross-environment behaviour that CI cannot
realistically exercise (real browsers, WSL↔Windows bridges, remote tunnels,
per-OS PTY/transport backends).

This directory grows lockstep with the [Rust client
rewrite](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-rust-client-rewrite-master-plan.md): each
phase authors its manual cases here as part of its definition of done.

**Every new feature MUST add manual checks here as part of its definition of
done** — not only rewrite phases. Add or update a feature file (see
[Test-case shape](#test-case-shape)) and link it from [Cases by phase](#cases-by-phase).

## Layout

- `README.md` — this index.
- `configuration-matrix.md` — top-level matrix dimensions and cross-environment
  cells (added when the first cross-environment phase lands).
- `phaseNN-<feature>.md` — one file per phase/feature, each holding full test
  cases.
- `results/<version>.md` — per-release results snapshot: versioned, diffable
  result tables recording pass/fail per matrix cell with date, tester, and notes.

## Test-case shape

Each case records: **ID**, feature/phase, preconditions, config-matrix cell
(where applicable), numbered steps, expected result, platforms, and a
result-tracking row.

## Recording results

Copy the result-tracking row from a case into `results/<version>.md` and fill in
date, tester, platform, and pass/fail when you run it against a release
candidate.
